# Formula 9 Framework Core Classes

This repository is a compendium of loosely coupled modules that existed in the previous version of Formula 9.
 I don't have any current plans to break it apart again. However, I may do so in the future.
 
This is primarily for my own entertainment and use. Considering how many MVC-ish PHP Frameworks there are out in 
 the wild, I can't imagine how anyone would want to use this. Other than me. As such, it is designed for my own use and with my own 
 quirky preferences. Much of it is either inspired by similar works, or includes the works of others.
 
To install use the following:

    composer require formula9/framework
    
or add the following to composer.json
    
    "formula9/framework" : "dev-master"
    
usually with 
    
        "minimum-stability": "dev",

Or you can fork it and fill your boots.

## Coming Soon

* A large number of tests exist for the framework. However, I'm not ready to release them as yet. 
* An example application of the Formula9 Framework exists. However, it is not ready for prime time.
